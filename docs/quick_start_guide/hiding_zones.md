# Hiding Zones

At the end of the hiding period, the hider must be at a transit station/stop that is included in the game's map–this now acts as the center of their hiding zone. The hiding zone extends a certain distance in all directions from the transit station, forming a circle within which the hider may move freely until the **end game** begins. For small and medium games, the hiding zone extends a ¼ mile from the transit station; for large games, the hiding zone extends a ½ mile from the transit station. (For more information on hiding zones and hiding spots, visit [Hiding Zones](../hiding/hiding_zones))
