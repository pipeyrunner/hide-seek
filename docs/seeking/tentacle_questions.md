# Tentacle Questions

Tentacle questions follow the format, "Within \_\_\_\_ miles of me, which \_\_\_\_ are you nearest to? (You must also be within \_\_\_\_)" If the hider is within the reach of the tentacle question, they must answer with the name of one of the locations requested. If the hider is not within reach of the tentacle question, they may simply answer that they are not within reach. Hiders have five minutes to answer. These questions are most useful near the end of the game, to quickly dispense of density at an extremely high cost. To help visualize this, think of each of these locations (say, all the zoos) becoming tentacles that shoot out from the seekers. They feel around, and one will hit the hider and ping back. 

After a tentacle question has been answered, the hider may **draw 4 cards and keep 2**. 

Here's a little diagram to help illustrate how tentacle questions can work:
