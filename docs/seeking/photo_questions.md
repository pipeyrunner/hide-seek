# Photo Questions

Photo questions follow the format, "Send me a photo of \_\_\_\_.." Valid answers are a photo that meets the full specifications of the photo question, or "I cannot answer the question," in situations where the subject of the photograph doesn't exist in the hiding zone. Hiders have ten minutes to answer in small and medium games, and twenty minutes to answer in large games. All photos must be sent in your phone's normal aspect ratio. Photos are a useful way of getting a general sense of where the hider is, or for verifying that you've arrived at the right location, but you cannot access Google Street View to assess photos or verify stations from afar.

These are photo questions available to the seekers in **small sized games**:

#### Any Building Visible from Transit Station

Must stand directly outside a station entrance. If there are multiple entrances, you may choose. Must include roof and both sides, with the top of the building in the top ⅓ of the frame.

#### Widest Street

Must include both sides of the street; does not have to include background.

#### Tree

Must include the entire tree.

#### Tallest Structure in Your Current Sightline

This is the tallest building from your perspective, not the objectively tallest building. If you can see the Burj Khalifa miles and miles away, but a nearby apartment building is taller from your perspective/sightline, you would send the apartment building.

Must include top and both sides. The top must be in the top **⅓** of the frame.

#### You

Selfie mode. Phone perpendicular to ground, arm fully extended, using your phone's default lens with no zoom.

#### The Sky

Place phone on ground, shoot directly up using your phone's default lens with no zoom.

import LabelPill from '@site/src/components/LabelPill';

### For <LabelPill label='MEDIUM'/> and <LabelPill label='LARGE'/> Sized Games, Add the Following:

#### Tallest Building Visible from Transit Station

This is the tallest building from your perspective, not the objectively tallest building. If you can see the Burj Khalifa miles and miles away, but a nearby apartment building is taller from your perspective/sightline, you would send the apartment building.

Must stand directly outside a station entrance. If there are multiple entrances, you may choose. Must include roof and both sides, with the top of the building in the top ⅓ of the frame.

In general, the transit station itself cannot count as the tallest building visible from the transit station. The exception would be if atop the transit station is a tall building whose purpose is unrelated to the transit station. For example, atop Grand Central Station is the MetLife building. This would count as the tallest building visible from the transit station.

#### Trace Nearest Street/Path

Street/path must be visible on mapping app; trace intersection to intersection.

This can be a little tricky to do; we have a few methods. One is to screenshot this on your phone, then use the drawing tools on your phone's photo editing app to black out everything but the street. Another is to put a piece of paper over your phone and trace with a pen/pencil/marker.

#### 2 Buildings

Must include bottom and up to four stories.

#### Restaurant Interior

No zoom. Must take the picture through the window from outside the restaurant. 

#### Park

No zoom, phone perpendicular to the ground. Must stand 5 feet from any obstruction.

#### Grocery Store Aisle

o zoom. Stand at the end of the aisle, shoot directly down.

#### Place of Worship

Must include a 5' × 5' section with three distinct elements. The litmus test for the distinct elements is: if someone went to that place and found what you took a picture of, they could confidently match it, and be sure it wasn't taken somewhere else.

#### Train Platform

Must include a 5' × 5' section with three distinct elements. The litmus test for the distinct elements is: if someone went to that place and found what you took a picture of, they could confidently match it, and be sure it wasn't taken somewhere else.

### For <LabelPill label='LARGE'/> Sized Games, Add the Following:

#### ½ Mile of Streets Traced

Must be continuous, include 5 turns, with no doubling back. Send north-south oriented. Streets must appear on mapping app.

As mentioned before, this can be a little tricky to do; we have a few methods. One is to screenshot this on your phone, then use the drawing tools on your phone's photo editing app to black out everything but the street. Another is to put a piece of paper over your phone and trace with a pen/pencil/marker.

#### Tallest Mountain Visible from Transit Station

Tallest from your perspective/sightline. If you could see Mount Everest many many miles away, but another nearby mountain looks taller from your perspective, you would send the nearby mountain.

Max 3x zoom; top of mountain must be in top ⅓ of frame.

#### The Biggest Body of Water in Your Zone
Max 3x zoom. Must include either both sides of body of water or the horizon. If a body of water is visible from the hider's zone, but no part of it touches the zone, it does not count. However, if a large body of water partially touches the hider's zone, but the part of it inside the zone is smaller than another body of water in the zone, the larger overall body water would still be considered the largest in the zone.

#### 5 Buildings

Must include bottom and up to four stories.

After a photo question has been answered, the hider may **draw 1 card and keep 1**.
