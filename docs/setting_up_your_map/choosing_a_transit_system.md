# Выбор транспортной системы

Your local transit system is the backbone of _Hide and Seek_. While this game can be played with cars or on foot, as we will detail later, we **strongly recommend using public transit for this game**. _Hide and Seek_ can be played on trains, trams, metros, light rails, buses, ferries, or any other form of public transit, but you'll need to define which systems are in play before starting your game. Given that each hiding zone will be centered around a transit station, it's crucial that your game includes a sufficient number of stations to keep it engaging and open-ended–this should determine how many different systems you'll want to include. (If, for example, you have a metro system that only has a few dozen stops, you should consider layering a bus system on top of it to increase complexity.)

Here is our best estimate for ideal map size and transit complexity in different scale games:

import SizeLevels from '@site/src/components/SizeLevels';

<SizeLevels
leftTitle="Масштаб игры"
rightTitle="транспортная система/размер карты"
align="left"
small={'30 – 100 станций; 25 – 250 квадратных километров'}
medium={'100 – 500 станций; 250 – 2500 квадратных километров'}
large={'500+ станций; 2500+ квадратных километров'}
/>

_(As a point of comparison, our game in Switzerland comprised about 1,800 stations, and our game in Japan was slightly over 8,500. Both would be considered "Large.")_
